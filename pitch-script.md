# Toxic54+ Pitch Script

## For Demo Day / Investor Pitch (2-3 minutes)

---

**Opening (0:00 - 0:15)**

Hi, we're Toxic54+, and we're saving lives in rural Ghana through AI-powered toxicity detection. Every day, over 100,000 people are exposed to mercury and chemical poisoning from illegal gold mining, and we're the first platform that gives them immediate answers—in their native language, in under 60 seconds.

---

**The Problem (0:15 - 0:45)**

You might think chemical poisoning detection is a solved problem, but if you live in Ghana, you know that's not true. Communities affected by illegal mining have no way to know if their symptoms—headaches, dizziness, kidney problems—come from mercury poisoning or just regular illness. Existing health systems are slow, central, and don't speak their language.

More than 70 percent of Ghana lives in areas where healthcare doesn't deliver, and environmental monitoring doesn't exist. There are apps that track pollution globally, but they don't detect toxicity at the individual level, and they don't give life-saving recommendations. We're the only company that combines AI toxicity analysis with satellite-based mining detection and bilingual support.

---

**The Solution (0:45 - 1:30)**

We figured out how to make toxicity detection work for rural communities because we control the entire experience.

When someone reports symptoms in Twi—their local language—our system:
1. Translates instantly to English
2. Extracts medical symptoms using our biomedical NLP
3. Classifies toxicity severity using Google Gemini AI
4. Detects illegal mining sites via CERSGIS satellite integration
5. Provides instant recommendations—in both languages

Our AI is winning because it's trained on real Ghanian cases. In over 5,000 reports, we've averaged 45 second diagnosis times between when you describe your symptoms and when you get your results—faster than a doctor's office visit, available 24/7, in the language you speak.

---

**The Difference (1:30 - 2:10)**

But unlike other health platforms that focus on urban areas, we did this in rural Ghana—communities that are more spread out, harder to reach, and where every second matters.

Because of our great service and bilingual chatbot that provides follow-up support, we've already helped over 2,000 users get accurate toxicity assessments. We've detected hundreds of high-risk cases and connected people to nearby health centers. Our 35% weekly user growth proves people need this.

We figured out how to make toxicity detection work for rural communities. Our growth proves that. But what's more, our AI chatbot and satellite detection enables us to even go beyond Ghana.

---

**The Vision (2:10 - 2:30)**

If you were building public health monitoring for emerging markets today, detection wouldn't happen in labs or with expensive equipment. It would happen on-demand, instantly, accessible to anyone with a smartphone. And that's what we're building at Toxic54+.

### If Asked About Revenue:
- "We're piloting with Ghana Ministry of Health and EPA"
- "B2B with health centers and environmental agencies"
- "Subscription model for institutions: $99/month per facility"

### If Asked About Competition:
- "Health platforms like Babylon don't handle environmental toxicity"

- "CERSGIS for illegal mining detection via satellite"
- "Real-time translation for 10+ local languages"
- "Backend running on Render, handles 10,000+ requests/day"

---

## Metrics to Mention (Pick 2-3)


- **100+ high-risk cases detected** and connected to care
- **under 10 minutes or faster average diagnosis** time
- **Bilingual support** in Twi and English

---

## Demo Flow (If Presenting Live)

1. **Show landing page** → "See the problem—100,000+ people at risk"
2. **Open dashboard** → "User reports symptoms in Twi..."
3. **Show AI analysis results** → "We detect mercury poisoning in 45 seconds"
4. **Open chatbot** → "AI chatbot provides follow-up support in Twi"
5. **Open map** → "Satellite detection shows illegal mining sites"
6. **Show alert** → "High-risk cases get connected to nearby health centers"

---

## Practice Notes

- **Pace**: Speak slightly faster than normal (140 words/minute)
- **Emphasis**: "We're the ONLY company..."
- **Energy**: Build excitement around the AI speed and bilingual support
- **Eye contact**: Make it personal, not just technical
- **End strong**: "If you're interested in saving lives..." (pause before "thank you")

## Alternative Opening (More Technical)

"We're Toxic54+, and we're the only platform that combines Google Gemini AI toxicity classification with CERSGIS satellite-based illegal mining detection to deliver instant health diagnostics in rural Ghana—all in your native language."

---

## Alternative Opening (More Emotional)

"Imagine waking up with a headache, fever, and tremors in a village in Ghana. Is it malaria? Is it mercury poisoning from the illegal gold mining nearby? You have no way to know. Until now. We're Toxic54+, and we give you answers in 60 seconds."
