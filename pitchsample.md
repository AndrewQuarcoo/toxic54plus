(00:01) hi we're doordash and we enable every restaurant to deliver for customers we offer restaurant food delivery in under 45 minutes and for restaurant owners we provide our own drivers and we manage the logistics of delivery now you might think that food delivery is a solved problem but if you live in menlo park or palo alto you know that's not true outside of pizza joints just about no restaurant in this area delivers therefore services like seamless or grub hub which merely aggregate menus but don't actually deliver
(00:37) don't work in fact that means the market is underserved because over 70 percent of the united states live in areas where restaurants don't deliver now there are courier services who are sending people to take to place takeout orders on your behalf but because they don't partner with the merchants they are slower and structurally more expensive we're the only company in this space that manages both our own logistics and partners with the merchants we figured out the model to make consumer deliveries work because we control the entire experience
(01:13) of delivery we offer the best performance at the same cost when an order is made in our system it gets placed immediately at an ipad installed at the restaurant we've also built logistics software to make it dead simple for any driver to onboard into our network our logistics model is winning in over 3 500 deliveries we've averaged 44 minute delivery times between when you place your order and when you receive your food better than our peers but unlike our peers who operate in the cities we did this in the suburb of palo
(01:47) alto an area that's much more spread out and more difficult because of our great service we've grown our weekly orders by over 30 percent week over week and we've already generated over 1.5 million dollars in annualized sales for our restaurants we figured out how to make consumer deliveries work our growth proves that but what's more our driver network and logistics software enables us to even go beyond food if you were building the fedex of today to manage local deliveries deliveries wouldn't happen overnight or
(02:27) even same day they would happen on demand and that's what we're building at doordash if you're interested in hearing more please come find us afterwards thank you
